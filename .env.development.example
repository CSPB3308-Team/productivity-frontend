VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000

# Make a file called .env.development in the root directory of the 
# project, defining VITE_BACKEND_URL as above. The port at the end 
# (5000 in the example above) should be the port the Flask app is 
# running on in Docker. You may have to change it to 3308 or something 
# else if another process is occupying 5000. (I do). Just make sure it 
# is the same between frontend and backend.
